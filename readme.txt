%%% Non-local Active Contours
% ***Two Non-local models: "un-normalized" (NL-U) / " normalized" (NL-N)
%
% (1) L2-distance: pixel values (intensity, color, Gabor coefficient)
% (2) Wasserstein distance: texture 
% (3) Motion distance using motion profiles
%
% *** Multiphase methods: MR (Repulsive) / MI (Intersection) method
% 
%%% choose method:
% @ choose_LSF_num = '1', '2', '3'
% @ metric = 'l2-1d','l2-3d','l2-gabor','wasserstein-1d',
% 'wasserstein-3d','motion-1d', 'motion-3d'
% @ multiphase_model = 'MR', 'MI' (when Choose_LSF_num=2 or 3)
% @ nl_model = 'unnormalized', 'normalized'
%
%%% choose (common) parameters 
% @ w: half size of patch "p" (or "pi" for motion distance)
% @ (q. sigma): half size of G_sigma(x,y)
% @ niter = total iteration # for LSF evolution
% @ redis_num = redistancing step for LSF 
% @ dt = step size for LSF evolution
% @ gamma = regularization parameter
%
%%% Additional parameters
% @ L2-distance: gau_a = weights in the distance
% @ L2-Gabor: [ntheta, nsigma, nfreq] for Gabor transforms
%             sigma_start, [freq_start freq_end]
% @ Wasserstein-3d: choose the directions for projection 
%                   (here, fixed as [1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1])
% @ Motion-distance: ndx = half size of motion profile (=ndy)
%                    sigm = tuning parameter 
% @ Multiphase-MR method: mu = parameter for Repulsive term
